# 13 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): E-Commerce Back End

## Description

- My motivation was to build a application that is the back-end to a E-commerce site.
- I built this to help stores keep track of their inventory
- The problem I solved is that stores no longer have to keep track of the inventory with out dated tech.
- This application is built using Node.js, MySQL database, Express.js, and Sequelize.
